1.  What does loose coupling mean?
    Loose coupling is an approach to interconnecting the components in a system or 
    network so that those components, also called elements, depend on each other to
    the least extent practicable. Coupling refers to the degree of direct knowledge 
    that one element has of another.
    
    Example : If you change your shirt, then you are not forced to change your body
    
2. What is the meaning of high cohesion?
    how closely all the routines in a class, or all the code in a routine, support a central purpose.
    high cohesion means that class should do one thing and one thing very well

3. How do you define single responsibility?
    the concept that any single object in object-oriented programing (OOP)
    should be made for one specific function
    
4. What is the open closed principle?
    a design principle that states that software components (such as classes and methods) should be open
    for extension but closed for modification


5. What is meant by Interface Segregation Principle?
    Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use
    
6. What is the dependency inversion principle in simple terms?
    high-level modules should depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.
