How do I know that I should be using a Matrix solution?

- The shape of the data (rectangular)
- "Matrix"

How do I solve a matrix problem?

- Matrices are a form of graph
  -- So often we can use graph algorithms, such as DFS and BFS
- Sometimes we can use simple nested for loops
- Sometimes geometric properties are important

Write a template for backtracking on a matrix

backtrack(matrix, next_node)

  if next_node is outside the matrix
     return true
  for digits 1 through 9
     set matrix[next_node] to digit
     if valid_soduku(matrix) then
        if backtrack(matrix, new next_node) return true
  set matrix[next_node] to '.'
  return false
   



What is the runtime and space complexity of a Matrix traversal 
(nested loop) algorithm?

Time: N*M
Space: size of output

What is the runtime and space complexity of a Matrix backtracking algorithm?

Time: 4^(N*M)
Space: N*M + size of output
