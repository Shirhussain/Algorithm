# Snake and Ladder Problem
# Last Updated : 14 Feb, 2023

# Given a snake and ladder board, find the minimum number of dice throws required to reach the destination or
# last cell from the source or 1st cell. Basically, the player has total control over
# the outcome of the dice throw and wants to find out the minimum number of
# throws required to reach the last cell.
# If the player reaches a cell which is the base of a ladder,
# the player has to climb up that ladder and if reaches a cell is the mouth of
# the snake, and has to go down to the tail of the snake without a dice throw.
